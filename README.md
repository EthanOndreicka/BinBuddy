# BinBuddy
BinBuddy is an iOS app built completely in swift that allows you to keep track of all your belongings that you store away.

# How it works
When users are setting up a bin, they have the option to generate a qr code, scan an NFC tag^, or take a photo to uniquley identify the specific bin.
Once the box has a unique identifier, you are able to name it and a description. After that you are able to add all individual items with names and photos if you choose.
Now you are all setup and ready to stay organized!

## Data Storage

All BoxBuddy data — including:

- Box names and descriptions

- Tags and item lists

- Photos of boxes and items

- QR code data
is stored **entirely** on the user’s device using Apple’s SwiftData framework. No data is uploaded to any server by default, ensuring user privacy and offline access.



###### ^ Currently NFC Scanning is not available as that feature is locked behind the Apple Developer subscription
